# NLP-Classification-Pipeline-using-NLTK-and-ML-Models
This project demonstrates a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow using Python and NLTK for text classification. The pipeline includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building with evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Features
->Text Preprocessing with NLTK: Tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, and lemmatization.
->Stopword Removal: Custom and NLTK-based stopword filtering.
->Feature Engineering: TF-IDF and count vectorization for transforming textual data.
->Encoding & Decoding: Label encoding of target variables for supervised learning.
->Model Implementation:
  Logistic Regression
  Naive Bayes
  Support Vector Machine
  Random Forest
  XGBoost 
->Evaluation Metrics: Outputs model-wise accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance comparison.
